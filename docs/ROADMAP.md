# VOS Roadmap

N0–N3 are complete. N3 closure was accepted on 2026-10-24 after the existing
D1/D2/C20 requirements passed. The milestone is published on
`feat/n3.6-storage-closure`; main remains N3.5 until a separately authorized
merge. See [status](STATUS.md) and the [N3 closure record](results/n3-closure.md).

## Completed

| Milestone | Delivered capability | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N0 | Original i386 boot and serial baseline | `m1-32bit` history; legacy `arch/i386/` |
| N1 | Ring-3 ELF programs and ABI v0 system calls | [Plan/results](plans/n1-user-space.md) |
| N2 | Protected memory/stacks, kernel threads, user preemption and ABI v1 channels | [Foundation](plans/n2-foundation.md) |
| N3.0 | Storage-safe higher-half kernel map | [Storage plan](plans/n3-storage.md) |
| N3.1 | Read-only virtio-blk | [Storage plan](plans/n3-storage.md) |
| N3.2 | Block registry and read-only cache | [Storage plan](plans/n3-storage.md) |
| N3.3 | Read-only ext2 reader | [Storage plan](plans/n3-storage.md) |
| N3.4 | Bounded interrupt-driven block I/O and polling fallback | [Storage plan](plans/n3-storage.md) |
| N3.5 | Capability-scoped read-only ABI v2 files/directories | [Historical closure](results/n3.5-closure.md) |
| N3.6 / N3 | Integrated accounting/stress, final regression, five mutations, fifteen larger-RAM runs and preserved evidence | [Final N3 closure](results/n3-closure.md) |
| U0/U1 | QEMU UEFI feasibility/readiness, BIOS compatibility and framebuffer diagnostics | [UEFI plan/results](plans/uefi.md) |

## Next: N4

The next development milestone is **keyboard input, an interactive console,
`vsh` and Rust-first native application foundations**. Its implementation has
not started and requires explicit authorization. The current C/assembly kernel,
ABI boundaries and completed read-only storage work form its baseline.
This roadmap update does not add N3 requirements or authorize N4 code.

## Later work

| Area | Scope still to be designed/authorized |
| --- | --- |
| U2 | IOAPIC/local APIC or MSI-X support and broader verified framebuffer formats |
| U3 | Independent EFI loader, then Secure Boot |
| H2 | Controlled physical-hardware tests, with explicit approval of each step |
| Other milestones | Writable storage, networking and later native UI/platform work remain future designs |

Current limitations are listed in [STATUS](STATUS.md) and the closure record:
QEMU-only verification, trusted immutable read-only media, RAM tracked below
1 GiB, UEFI polling, bounded operations without real-time/fairness guarantees,
retained DMA quarantine after unconfirmed reset, incomplete full dynamic stack
high-water proof and the documented deep/sparse-directory progress limits.
